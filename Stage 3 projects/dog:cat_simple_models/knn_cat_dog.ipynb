    "    - Fastest, but very blocky and ugly. Good for pixel art or masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- cv.INTER_LINEAR \n",
    "    - Bilinear interpolation (average of 4 neighboring pixels).  \n",
    "    - Default. Good for shrinking or slight enlarging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- cv.INTER_CUBIC \n",
    "    - Bicubic interpolation (average of 16 neighboring pixels). \n",
    "    - Slower, but better quality for enlarging images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- cv.INTER_LANCZOS4 \n",
    "    - Lanczos interpolation over 8Ã—8 pixel neighborhood. \n",

    "    - Resampling using pixel area relation. \n",
