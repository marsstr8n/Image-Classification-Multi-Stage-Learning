# 3 small projects are included
## Light or Dark
Separate images as light or dark - using luminance and textures

### Skills learnt
- Image processing
- OpenCV libraries
- Calculation and transformation of image pixels for classification tasks
- Visualisation of the result

### Skills learnt:
- Using OpenCV, extract image vectors

## Dog/Cat classification
- In the total of 25000 cat and dog images taken from Kaggle, the data is loaded and preprocessed, ready for downstream analysis
- Two different models are used: K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression for classifying dog or cat
- The models undergo hyperparameter tuning to find the best results in the test set.

### Skills learnt
- Understand the maths involved in KNN and Logistic Regression
- Image processing - how to extract and preprocess images
- How to gain information from images so that machine can understand
- Build a pipeline: Instead of using Jupyter Notebook files like previous projects, functions are modularised
- GridSearchCV and K-fold validation: Finding the best parameters for the highest accuracy
