# Image-Classification-Multi-Stage-Learning

The aim of this project is to classify images of cats and dogs - using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, since this is a new field for me, I want to fully understand how CNN works. This leads me to transform this project into a learning experience. 

I'll start small, from learning how image processing works, classification not using neural networks, build a neural network from scratch - then once I have a solid understanding, I shall tackle the classification project. 

Below list the project steps:


1️⃣ **Basics of Image Processing (No Machine Learning Yet)**
Goal: Learn how to load, manipulate, and process images using Python.
* Project: Load an image and convert it to grayscale using PIL or OpenCV.
* Project: Resize, rotate, and crop images manually.
* Project: Convert an image to a NumPy array and visualize pixel values.
Concepts: Pixels, image representation, RGB vs. grayscale, basic transformations.

2️⃣ **Feature Extraction & Simple Image Analysis**
Goal: Understand how to extract information from images without ML.
* Project: Convert an image to black and white using thresholding.
* Project: Detect edges in an image using the Sobel or Canny operator.
* Project: Compute the average color of an image.
* Project: Compare two images using histograms.
Concepts: Histograms, edge detection, filtering, basic feature extraction.

3️⃣ **Simple Classification Without Deep Learning**
Goal: Classify images without a neural network using manual features.
* Project: Manually extract features (like color, texture) and classify simple objects (e.g., separate light vs. dark images).
* Project: Use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify small images (e.g., separate cats vs. dogs using only color histograms).
* Project: Build a simple logistic regression classifier for two-class image classification.
Concepts: Feature engineering, KNN, logistic regression, train-test split.

4️⃣ **Building a Simple Neural Network (From Scratch)**
Goal: Implement a basic neural network without deep learning frameworks.
* Project: Implement a single-layer perceptron using NumPy for binary classification.
* Project: Implement a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with manual forward and backward propagation.
* Project: Train an MLP on tiny datasets (e.g., classifying simple shapes).
Concepts: Neural networks, activation functions, backpropagation.

5️⃣ **Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification**
Goal: Train a CNN from scratch for small image datasets.
* Project: Implement convolution manually using NumPy (to understand how filters work).
* Project: Build a small CNN using a minimalistic approach (maybe just NumPy at first).
* Project: Train a CNN on a simple dataset (e.g., MNIST digits).
* Project: Finally, train a CNN on a small dog vs. cat dataset.
Concepts: CNNs, convolution, pooling, backpropagation in deep networks.

**Final Step: Full Dog vs. Cat Classifier**
Goal: Train a CNN for real-world dog vs. cat classification.
* Project: Use a small dataset (like Kaggle's Cat vs. Dog dataset).
* Project: Implement data augmentation to improve performance.
* Project: Fine-tune a pre-trained model to get better accuracy.
Concepts: Transfer learning, augmentation, model evaluation.
